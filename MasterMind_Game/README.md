# Mastermind Game

Welcome to Mastermind, a classic code-breaking game I implemented in Ruby! as part of  The Odin Project's Ruby curriculum.

## Description

Mastermind is a two-player game where one player (the code-maker) creates a secret code, and the other player (the code-breaker) tries to guess the code within a certain number of turns. The code is a sequence of colored pegs, and the code-breaker must use logic and deduction to figure out the correct sequence.

## Features

- Single-player mode: Play against the computer, which generates a secret code for you to guess.
<!-- - Multi-player mode: Play against a friend, taking turns to create and guess secret codes. -->
- Customizable settings: Choose the number of pegs in the code, the number of colors available, and the number of turns allowed.
- Intelligent computer player: The computer uses heuristic algorithms to make strategic guesses and crack your code.

## Getting Started

To play the game, you'll need Ruby installed on your computer. Clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory.

```
https://github.com/mutaician/ruby-exercises-odin/tree/main/MasterMind_Game
cd MasterMind_Game
```

Run the following command to start the game:

```
ruby main.rb
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## How to Play

- Choose whether you want to create the secret code or guess it.
- If you're the code-maker, enter your secret code.
- If you're the code-breaker, try to guess the secret code.
- After each guess, you'll receive feedback on how close you are to the correct code.
- Keep guessing until you crack the code or run out of turns.

## Binary Search Tree (BST)

Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure in Ruby I implemented as part of [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-binary-search-trees)

### Overview

A binary search tree is a data structure that allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations. In a binary search tree, each node has at most two children: a left child and a right child. The key property of a binary search tree is that for any node, all nodes in its left subtree have values less than its value, and all nodes in its right subtree have values greater than its value.

This project includes the following functionalities:

- Insertion of values into the tree
- Traversal methods: inorder, preorder, and postorder
- Calculation of tree height
- Checking if the tree is balanced
- Finding the depth of a value in the tree
- Deleting a value from the tree
- Balancing the tree if it's not balanced

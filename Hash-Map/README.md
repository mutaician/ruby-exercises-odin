## Hashmap

Hashmap data structure implementation in Ruby as part of [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-hashmap)
It provides efficient storage and retrieval of key-value pairs and supports common hashmap operations.

### Features

- **Key-Value Pair Storage**: Store and retrieve key-value pairs efficiently.
- **Dynamic Sizing**: Automatically resize the underlying data structure to accommodate varying numbers of elements.
- **Collision Handling**: Resolve collisions using separate chaining, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval even with hash collisions.
- **Custom Key Support**: Support for custom objects as keys, allowing flexibility in key types.
- **Comprehensive Methods**: Provides methods for setting, getting, removing, and querying key-value pairs, as well as retrieving all keys, values, and entries.

## Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman game! This is a simple implementation of the classic word guessing game in Ruby as part of [theodinproject Ruby projects](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-hangman#project-solution) 


### How to Play

1. Run the game by executing the `hangman.rb` file.
2. The game will select a random word, and you'll be prompted to guess letters.
3. Guess one letter at a time.
4. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed. If not, a part of the hangman will be drawn.
5. Continue guessing until you either guess the word correctly or the hangman is completed.
6. You can save your progress at any time by typing 'save' and load a saved game later.

### Installation

1. Make sure you have Ruby installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Run the command `ruby hangman.rb` to start the game.
